> Give AI the ability to "change one line of code, trace the full-chain impact" in large projects.

## What Problem Does It Solve

AI coding assistants excel at independent changes, but in large multi-module projects, modifying one component can cascade across multiple business domains. Typical pain points:

- Changed a Facade method signature, unaware that 5 other domains call it
- Fixed an MQ message format, missed 3 external system consumers
- Took on a "simple requirement" that actually involves state machine changes, shared resources, and end-to-end paths

ECW provides a structured change management workflow that makes AI assess risk, analyze impact, and cross-verify before writing code — ensuring nothing is missed.

## Core Concepts

### Three-Phase Risk Classification

ECW's core is a **P0-P3 four-level risk classification** that drives workflow depth:

| Level | Risk | Workflow Depth | Typical Scenarios |
|-------|------|---------------|------------------|
| **P0** | Critical | Full workflow: requirements elicitation → precise grading → full plan → adversarial review → implementation → cross-review → impact analysis → calibration | Multi-domain state machine changes, core path refactoring |
| **P1** | High | Full workflow minus adversarial review (except cross-domain) | Shared resource modifications, MQ format changes |
| **P2** | Medium | Simplified: plan → implementation → cross-review | Single-domain field additions, local logic adjustments |
| **P3** | Low | Direct implementation | Log adjustments, copy changes, config updates |

**Core principle: Changing a log line and changing inventory deduction should not require the same process.**

### Three Phases

| Phase | When | Data Source | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| **Phase 1** | After user describes requirement | Keyword matching + shared resource table | Quick risk prediction, determine workflow path |
| **Phase 2** | After requirement analysis | Full dependency graph (§1-§5) | Precise grading, upgrade/downgrade if needed |
| **Phase 3** | After implementation + impact analysis | biz-impact-analysis report | Calibrate prediction accuracy, improve classification rules |

### Knowledge-Driven Impact Analysis

ECW relies on project-level knowledge files for precise analysis. Five types of cross-domain knowledge form the dependency graph:

| # | Knowledge File | Content | Used By |
|---|---------------|---------|---------|
| §1 | `cross-domain-calls.md` | Domain-to-domain call matrix | Phase 2, domain-collab, biz-impact-analysis |
| §2 | `mq-topology.md` | MQ topic publish/subscribe relationships | Phase 1 (lightweight), Phase 2, biz-impact-analysis |
| §3 | `shared-resources.md` | Services/components shared by 2+ domains | Phase 1, Phase 2, biz-impact-analysis |
| §4 | `external-systems.md` | External system integrations | Phase 2, biz-impact-analysis |
| §5 | `e2e-paths.md` | End-to-end critical business paths | Phase 2, biz-impact-analysis |

## Components

### Skills (6)

| Component | Trigger | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `ecw:risk-classifier` | Any change/requirement/bug | P0-P3 risk classification + workflow routing, three phases (predict → precise → calibrate) |
| `ecw:domain-collab` | Cross-domain requirements (2+ domains) | Parallel domain agents analyze independently → mutual evaluation → coordinator cross-verification |
| `ecw:requirements-elicitation` | Single-domain P0/P1 requirements | 9-dimension systematic questioning to fully understand requirements |
| `ecw:spec-challenge` | After plan output (P0, P1 cross-domain) | Dispatches independent agent for adversarial plan review, challenge-response cycles |
| `ecw:cross-review` | After implementation | Structured multi-round cross-consistency verification, exits only on zero findings |
| `ecw:biz-impact-analysis` | After code review | Git diff → dispatches agent to analyze business impact, outputs structured report |

### Agents (2)

| Component | Dispatcher | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `biz-impact-analyzer` | `ecw:biz-impact-analysis` | 5-step analysis: diff parsing → dependency graph queries → code scanning → external system evaluation → report generation |
| `spec-challenger` | `ecw:spec-challenge` | 4-dimension review: accuracy / information quality / boundaries & blind spots / robustness → fatal flaws + improvement suggestions |

### Commands (2)

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/ecw-init` | Project initialization wizard (3 modes: Attach/Manual/Scaffold) |
| `/ecw-validate-config` | Validate ECW configuration completeness (7-step check, outputs pass/warn/fail report) |

### Hook (1)

| Component | Trigger | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `verify-completion` | PreToolUse auto-intercepts TaskUpdate(completed) | 3 hard blocks + 1 soft reminder |

**Hard blocks (failure → prevents completion):**
1. Broken reference check — modified files reference non-existent `.claude/` paths
2. Stale reference check — deleted files still referenced elsewhere
3. Java compilation check — auto-runs `mvn compile` when `.java` files are modified

**Soft reminder (non-blocking, injects systemMessage):**
4. Knowledge doc sync reminder — business code changed but corresponding domain knowledge docs not updated

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code CLI** — ECW is a Claude Code plugin, requires CLI environment
- **superpowers plugin** — Provides `writing-plans`, `executing-plans`, `systematic-debugging` and other foundational skills

### Step 1: Register Marketplace

Add to `extraKnownMarketplaces` in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "enterprise-change-workflow": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "Aimeerrhythm/enterprise-change-workflow"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Install Plugin

```bash
claude plugin install ecw@enterprise-change-workflow
```

Verify installation:

```bash
claude plugin list
# Should show ecw@enterprise-change-workflow
```

### Step 3: Enable Plugin

Confirm `enabledPlugins` in `~/.claude/settings.json` includes:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "ecw@enterprise-change-workflow": true
  }
}
```

> `claude plugin install` usually adds this entry automatically. If not, add it manually.

### Step 4: Restart Claude Code

Plugins load on next session start. Exit current session and restart Claude Code.

### Step 5: Initialize Project Configuration

Launch Claude Code in your target project directory and run:

```
/ecw-init
```

The initialization wizard supports 3 modes:

| Mode | Use Case | Creates |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Attach** | Project already has documentation | ECW config files only (5 files), preserves existing docs |
| **Manual** | Docs in non-standard locations | Config files + user-specified paths |
| **Scaffold** | New project | Config files + complete knowledge file templates |

Generated configuration files:

```
.claude/ecw/
├── ecw.yml                      # Project config: name, language, component types, scan patterns
├── domain-registry.md           # Domain registry: definitions, knowledge dirs, code dirs
├── change-risk-classification.md # Risk classification calibration: factor weights, keyword mappings
├── ecw-path-mappings.md         # Code path → domain mappings (used by biz-impact-analysis)
└── calibration-log.md           # Phase 3 calibration history (auto-appended)
```

### Step 6: Configure Project CLAUDE.md

Add ECW integration configuration to your project's `CLAUDE.md`. Refer to `templates/CLAUDE.md.snippet` for the template. Core content:

1. **Domain knowledge routing table** — keyword → domain mappings for risk-classifier and domain-collab
2. **Automation rules** — auto-invoke `ecw:risk-classifier` on change requests
3. **Completion verification rules** — structured self-check requirements before marking complete
4. **Impact analysis tool distinction** — `ecw:domain-collab` (requirements phase) vs `ecw:biz-impact-analysis` (code phase)

### Step 7: Populate Knowledge Files

Knowledge file quality directly determines impact analysis accuracy. Java/Spring projects can use built-in scanning scripts:

```bash
# Run in target project root directory
bash <plugin-path>/scripts/java/scan-cross-domain-calls.sh <project_root> <path_mappings_file>
bash <plugin-path>/scripts/java/scan-shared-resources.sh <project_root> <path_mappings_file>
bash <plugin-path>/scripts/java/scan-mq-topology.sh <project_root>
```

Scan results output Markdown tables to stdout, ready to paste into the corresponding knowledge files. Scans use grep heuristics (high recall, possible false positives) — manual review before committing is recommended.

### Verify Installation

```
/ecw-validate-config
```

This command runs 7-step checks and outputs pass/warn/fail status for each configuration file, helping you confirm configuration completeness.

## Knowledge File System

ECW relies on knowledge files in your project to make accurate domain judgments and impact analysis. Knowledge files live under `.claude/knowledge/`.

### Cross-Domain Common Knowledge (`common/`)

| File | Description | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | biz-impact-analysis |
|------|-------------|---------|---------|------------|
| `cross-domain-rules.md` | Index file, knowledge usage guide | — | Reference | Reference |
| `cross-domain-calls.md` (§1) | Domain-to-domain call matrix | — | Query | Query |
| `mq-topology.md` (§2) | MQ topic pub/sub relationships | Keywords | Query | Query |
| `shared-resources.md` (§3) | Cross-domain shared resource table | Query | Query | Query |
| `external-systems.md` (§4) | External system integration list | — | Query | Query |
| `e2e-paths.md` (§5) | End-to-end critical business paths | — | Query | Query |

### Domain-Level Knowledge (one directory per domain)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `00-index.md` | Domain entry: path lookup, node locations, Facade maps, external system interactions |
| `business-rules.md` | Business rules: concurrency control, idempotency, state machines, validation rules, cross-domain constraints |
| `data-model.md` | Data model: core table structures, enum definitions, ER relationships, indexes |

## Supported Project Types

`ecw.yml` adapts to different tech stacks via `component_types` and `scan_patterns`:

| Tech Stack | Typical Component Types | Scan Patterns |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Java/Spring** | BizService, Manager, DO, Controller, Mapper | @Resource, @DubboReference, RocketMQ |
| **Go** | Handler, Repository, Service | import, interface |
| **Node/TypeScript** | Service, Controller, Middleware | import/require, EventEmitter |
| **Python** | Service, Repository, Handler | import, Celery |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: `/ecw-init` ran but `/ecw-validate-config` shows many warnings?**

A: Expected behavior. `ecw-init` generates template files that need to be filled with your project's actual content. Complete items based on the priority indicated in the validate report.

**Q: verify-completion hook reports "broken reference"?**

A: A file you modified references a `.claude/` path that doesn't exist. Check for typos or if the referenced file has been moved/deleted.

**Q: Java compilation check blocks task completion?**

A: Compilation must pass before completion is allowed. Fix compilation errors and re-mark as complete. If mvn is not in PATH, the compilation check is automatically skipped.

**Q: Phase 1 risk level is obviously inaccurate?**

A: Two common causes: (1) Keyword mappings in `change-risk-classification.md` aren't comprehensive enough — add missing keywords; (2) `shared-resources.md` is missing shared resource entries — re-run scanning scripts or add manually. Phase 3 calibration suggestions can help you systematically improve.

**Q: Knowledge files are empty, impact analysis is poor?**

A: Knowledge file quality directly determines analysis quality. For Java/Spring projects, use the scanning scripts under `scripts/java/` for automated extraction first, then review and supplement manually. Other tech stacks require manual population.
